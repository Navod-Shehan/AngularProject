Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone or download your Angular project to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.

Run the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

After the installation is complete, run the command "ng serve" to start a local development server.

Open your web browser and go to "http://localhost:4200/". You should see your Angular application running on the local development server.

Note:

ng serve command will start the development server on port 4200. If that port is already in use, you can specify a different one using the --port flag (e.g. ng serve --port 4300).
If you want to build your application for production, use the command "ng build --prod". This will create a production-ready build of your application in the "dist" directory.
Now your angular project is deployed locally and ready to use.
